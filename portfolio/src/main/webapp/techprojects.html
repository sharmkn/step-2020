        <h2>Roombaby</h2>
        <p>The roomba has always been a really interesting invention to me,
            which is why when my security course asked us to do a project on
            anything we wanted as long as it related to security, of course
            I decided to make a beeline for a secondhand roomba to expose its 
            vulnerabilities - however, this didn't work out, considering I 
            had no experience in anything of the sort - but I did write an 
            application to send commands to it, the most interesting (in my 
            opinion) being the ability to send it hex codes to play particular
            musical notes, essentially allowing you to get your roomba to 'sing'.
        </p>
        <h2>When to Buy</h2>
        <p>I learned of the existence of web scraping early 2019, and when I did
            I started bouncing off the walls. I know it's a really small concept,
            but I think it is so cool, and of course, as somebody who is one small
            nudge away from being a person with bad spending habits, I wrote an
            application that checked for the price of an ASOS item (I did not 
            understand the significance and beauty of classes, so it has only been
            done for ASOS and not other sites) and notified the user via email when 
            the price went down. While giving me a brief introduction to Beautiful 
            Soup, it also taught me about how to send emails through Python programs. 
            Wack.
