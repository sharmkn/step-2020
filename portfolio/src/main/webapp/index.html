      <h1>Sharmin Zaman</h1>
      <p>I like sewing and eating fried chicken. Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
      <p>
          I'm a Mechatronic Engineering and Computer Science student at UNSW.
          I didn't have many hobbies prior to quarantine, and now I constantly
          want to make more things, which is a blessing and a curse, as there's
          always something new to learn but also not enough time to do everything.
          Right now, I'm trying to get into rug making! It's a lengthy process,
          so I'm hoping to build a device that will allow for faster tufting!
