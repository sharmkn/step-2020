        <h2>Cow Bucket Hat</h2>
        <div id = "info">
            <p>
                With assistance from a sewing pattern found online, I made this 
                <i>beautiful </i> cow hat. It took about 3 hours to do considering the
                material was awfully thick and I broke about 3 machine needles in the 
                process. Can you tell frogs are my favourite animals?

        <h2>Tyler, the Creator's IGOR</h2>
        <div id = "info">
            <p>
                The hugest leap I could have made from a hat, I decided to make a 
                full Halloween costume, complete with a matching face mask. Tyler,
                the Creator wore a pink and red suit for the concept of his latest
                album, IGOR, and in spirit of that, I decided to recreate it 
                in the form of a button-up and shorts, a combination I was 
                more likely to wear on a regular basis (we are, after all, making
                clothes ourselves for sustainability purposes, which also
                means everything I make should be used tens of times like anything
                else in my closet!).
