        <h2>Cow Bucket Hat</h2>
        <p>
            With assistance from a sewing pattern found online, I made this 
            <i>beautiful </i> cow hat. It took about 3 hours to do considering the
            material was awfully thick and I broke about 3 machine needles in the 
            process. Can you tell frogs are my favourite animals?

        <h2>Tyler, the Creator's IGOR</h2>
        <p>
            The hugest leap I could have made from a hat, I decided to make a 
            full Halloween costume, complete with a matching face mask. Tyler,
            the Creator wore a pink and red suit for the concept of his latest
            album, IGOR, and in spirit of that, I decided to recreate it 
            in the form of a button-up and shorts, a combination I was 
            more likely to wear on a regular basis (we are, after all, making
            clothes ourselves for sustainability purposes, which also
            means everything I make should be used tens of times like anything
            else in my closet!).
